# CacheGrinder

This is a port of an existing github project called WinCacheGrind (https://github.com/ceefour/wincachegrind)
WinCacheGrind is a viewer for cachegrind.out files generated by [xdebug 2](http://xdebug.org/).
WinCacheGrind is functionally similar to [KCacheGrind](http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/),
only it is much simpler and runs on Windows.

CacheGrinder was ported from Pascal to C# as the latest WinCacheGrind had a bug (https://github.com/ceefour/wincachegrind/issues/2)

## Usage

After compiling and running, open a cachegrind file.

## Disclaimers

I am a web developer, so this represents my first attempt at a production-level Windows Form.  
I have used Windows Forms for years, but only for internal purposes.

As mentioned above, this is a port from Pascal.  As much as possible, I attempted to preserve the original codebase.
This includes variable names, methods, properties, etc, as it made for a much easier porting.  This is not the way I would have
coded the project if I had started from scratch, in case you were wondering about coding style, camel-case, naming conventions, etc.

I am a long-time user of Team Foundation Services for source control, so am unfamiliar with Git except for scarce usage of GitHub, so please
be patient as I adapt to the usage.

This represents the V0.1, bug-laden, incomplete version of the project.  There are many many features from WinCacheGrind that are missing/TODO.

There are many bugs as well, and I am sure there are various flavors of XDebug/cachegrind that are not compatible, but that is part of the reason 
for the project.

Thanks for your patience.
